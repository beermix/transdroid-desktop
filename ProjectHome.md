A desktop client to remote connect to all your torrent clients. Multiple operating systems are supported through the Java (Swing) interface and many torrent clients are supported through the generic remote access library of the Transdroid project for Android.

So far Transdroid Desktop is a proof-of-concept with a simple interface on top of the Transdroid library.
